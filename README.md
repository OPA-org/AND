# AND
Android Network Discovery
# Description
Most network discovery tools are developed for desktop computers only and very little attention is given to mobile platform which can be very helpful for network administrators in network management and troubleshooting.
Itâ€™s easier to move around with a smartphone than a PC/Laptop to detect and monitor topology.
We chose to use SNMP to discover the network and did a detailed analysis of MIB modules which will be utilized to accomplish this. 
The reason for choosing SNMP is its better performance compared to other techniques and its capability to derive multiple properties of the devices, which can help in finding accurate connectivity with interface details and device types.
We tried to achieve simplicity, accuracy and efficiency in our algorithm.
## Features
1.	Discover network and show topology.
2.	Generate reports.
3.	Get devices statistics.
4.	Save and Load user reports.
